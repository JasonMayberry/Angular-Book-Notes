<!-- 
The ngOptions directive expects a comprehension expression. 
This expression can seem a little intimidating when you first 
encounter it, but we can break it down. It is essentially a 
query that we use to tell AngularJS how to map our model property, 
the person.channels array, in this case, onto a set of HTML options. 
This array contains a set of objects, and AngularJS would like to 
know which properties of this set should become the option elementâ€™s 
value and which should become the content visible to our end user.

Here is the expression again:
obj.value as obj.label for obj in person.channels

In plain English, this would read something like the following:

Use the value property on the option elements value attribute, 
and use the label property as the text displayed within the option element. 
Oh, and by the way, I am referring to the objects 
contained within theperson.channels array.
