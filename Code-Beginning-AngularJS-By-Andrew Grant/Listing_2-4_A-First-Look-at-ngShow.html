<!-- 
Listing 2-4 shows four paragraph elements, each has been “augmented” by an AngularJS directive 
that goes by the name of ngShow.

What does ngShow do?
 Much of the answer is in the name.
  The ngShow directive will show, or hide, the element on which it is declared,
  based on the expression provided to it. 
Load up Listing 2-4 in your browser, and you will see that only the first and third paragraphs appear 
(as confirmed in Figure 2-3). They only appear because, in both cases, their respective expressions 
evaluate to the Boolean value of true. The second and fourth paragraphs, however, do not appear 
because their respective ngShow expressions evaluate to the Boolean value of false.

* Tip If an ngShow expression evaluates to false, then a CSS class named .ng-hide is dynamically 
added to the element, causing it to become hidden. So, the element still exists in the DOM, 
but it is not displayed.
